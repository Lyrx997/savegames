# savegames

## Bunch of savegames (mostly racing games) that I have on my pc.

### Currently, there are 9 savegames in this repo:

- **Driver San Francisco** (Story cleared, all cars unlocked).
- **Far Cry 2** (Campaign cleared with Warren, not all weps are unlocked).
- **Need For Speed Carbon** (Career Completed save). For this game I use [KryZeePlays's modpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZqKkBw5jYs). Please enable **UnlockAllThings** into [NFSCExOpts](https://github.com/ExOptsTeam/NFSCExOpts) config file for better compatibility.
- **Need For Speed Hot Pursuit (2010)** (Career Completed). Use NFSHP_ModPack_v3_FINAL (Download [here (GDrive Mirror)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cxgEsSWPlB8K1ODcyyqPq3zDedqi8lat/view?usp=sharing)) from HSR_rizz2pro for better compatibility.
- **Need For Speed The Run** (Career Completed save).
- **Need For Speed Most Wanted (2012)** (DLCs included + Blacklist defeated + all mods unlocked on all cars). Remember to play in **Offline Mode** if you want to use this savegame on Origin/Steam versions.
- **NieR Automata** (Endings A-B-C-D-H-M-T).
- **Race Driver GRID** (Career completed, all cars unlocked). Install 8 Ball & Prestige Pack DLCs for a better experience.
- **Test Drive Unlimited 2** (Main campaign cleared, all roads unlocked, some activities are not cleared). You **must** use **TDU2 Unoffical Patch** and **TDU2 AutoPack** in order to use this savegame.
